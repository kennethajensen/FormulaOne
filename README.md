# Analyzing Formula 1 Data

This notebook retrieves and processes Formula 1 qualifying session data from [OpenF1](https://openf1.org/)'s open-source API.

The goal is to use this data to create a profile of how each track is driven and to then analyze the results to find groups of tracks that are similar and identify any anomalies or changes over time.

The article [Analyzing Formula 1 Data | How do I get some data, anyway?](https://medium.com/@kenneth.agregaard.jensen/analyzing-formula-1-data-part-1-5b745527516a) describes the first part of the project and the data retrieval in more detail and also contains links to the further analysis and results.
