        "It defaults to an empty string if no filter is provided.\n",

        "- `initial_retry_delay` (int): The starting delay in seconds before the first retry. Defaults to 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Functionality:**\n",

        "1. **Retry Loop:** It uses a `while` loop to attempt the API request up to `max_retries` times.\n",
        "2. **API Request:** It constructs the full API URL using the `base_url`, `endpoint`, and `filter`, then makes the request using `urlopen()`.\n",

        "6. **Other Error Handling:** Any other HTTP errors or unexpected exceptions are immediately re-raised, as they indicate a different kind of issue.\n",
