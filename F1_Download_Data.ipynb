        "\n",

        "1. **Retry Loop:** It uses a `while` loop to attempt the API request up to `max_retries` times.\n",
        "2. **API Request:** It constructs the full API URL using the `base_url`, `endpoint`, and `filter`, then makes the request using `urlopen()`.\n",
        "3. **JSON Parsing:** The response is read, decoded from bytes to UTF-8, and then parsed as a JSON object into a Python list of dictionaries.\n",
        "4. **DataFrame Conversion:** This JSON data is then converted into a Pandas DataFrame, making it easy to work with.\n",
        "5. Rate Limit Handling (HTTP 429): If the API returns an HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) error, the function prints a message, pauses for `retry_delay` seconds (which doubles with each subsequent retry – an exponential backoff strategy), and then retries the request.\n",
        "6. **Other Error Handling:** Any other HTTP errors or unexpected exceptions are immediately re-raised, as they indicate a different kind of issue.\n",

        "8. **Failure:** If all retries fail, an exception is raised, indicating that the data could not be retrieved.\n",
        "9. **Delay:** After a successful API call, it pauses for 1 second (`time.sleep(1)`) to proactively avoid hitting rate limits on subsequent calls."
